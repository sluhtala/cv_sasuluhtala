				<h4>PROFILE</h4>
				<p>I'm a student at Hive Helsinki and a programmer with
				curiosity and practical mindset. I want to be a full-stack
				developer because it offers many challenges and there is always
				something new to learn. A background in design provided me with
				creative problem solving skills and an education in a top coding
				school equipped me with the solid programming fundamentals but I now need to gain experience in a
				company environment. I'm an excellent candidate for junior or a
				trainee position with high potential.</p>

				<h4>EDUCATION</h4>
				<div class="education">
					<h5>Hive Helsinki (2019 - current)</h5>
					<p>Hive is a coding school that applies mastery based learning and solid fundamentals to education.
						It follows the system of French school Ecole-42 that has no teachers,
						classes or degree. At Hive everything
						starts from mastering the C-language with multiple projects individually and
						in groups.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="education">
					<h5>Tampere University of applied sciences (2013 – 2018)</h5>
					<p>If there is something I learned during the 4 years in Tamk,
						it was how to learn on my own and how to find reliable resources
						online. Also in Tamk I was introduced to programming and it made me want
						to apply to Hive.</p>
